  <h1>Help & How to Use</h1>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The NorCal Trim Calculator and Trim Tracker are tools designed to help trimmers track their daily weight and calculate bonus pay. All data is stored locally in your browser.</p>

  <h2>Using the Trim Calculator</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enter the total grams you trimmed for the day in the input box.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Add Today's Trim Tracker Total"</strong> to automatically import your weight from the Trim Tracker if you've logged it for today.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Calculate"</strong> to compute your bonus pay based on the current rate.</li>
    <li>Your result will appear in the session board below, including the bonus amount.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>"Delete"</strong> or <strong>"Clear All"</strong> buttons to manage your entries.</li>
    <li>You can also click <strong>"Export CSV"</strong> to save your records for backup.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using the Trim Tracker</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use this page to log each strain you trim, along with the amount (in grams).</li>
    <li>You can enter up to three gram totals per row, and click <strong>"+"</strong> to add more fields as needed.</li>
    <li>The tracker calculates your daily total automatically and saves it under the current date.</li>
    <li>Return to the calculator and click the green <strong>"Add Today's Trim Tracker Total"</strong> button to import your total for bonus calculation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tips & FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data is saved locally:</strong> Your entries stay saved in your browser unless you clear your cache or use a different device.</li>
    <li><strong>Language matters:</strong> Make sure you use the app consistently in either English or Spanish — mixing them may cause your data to be saved separately.</li>
    <li><strong>Backing up:</strong> Use the Export CSV option on either page to save a copy of your data manually.</li>
    <li><strong>Date syncing:</strong> The calculator only imports tracker data saved under today’s date. If no data is found, double-check that the tracker entry date matches today.</li>
  </ul>
